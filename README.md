# Hi, I'm Hafidz 👋

**Web Developer & Math Student @ ITS**

I enjoy turning ideas and class projects into real web applications that people actually use — especially for campus, communities, and learning. Most of my work lives around Laravel, Next.js, and relational databases, with a growing interest in data & AI.

## 📚 Teaching & learning

- Write small projects and examples to help friends and juniors understand **basic programming** and **algorithms**.
- Like refactoring “tugas kuliah” into something cleaner and reusable.
